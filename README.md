# skittle-sorter-3d

I made this skittle sorter for ista 303 at the UofA. There was sadly some data loss for the 3d print, such as the legs. I tried creating them, making them close enough. 

The model was created in openscad. The code for the model is not up to stuff, but it works well enough due to how openscad works.

This got me second place in the ishowcase with around 44 second time with 85% accuracy.
