# skittle-sorter-3d





I made this skittle sorter for ista 303 at the UofA. There was sadly some data loss for the 3d print, such as the legs. I tried creating them, making them close enough. 

This got me second place in the ishowcase with around 44 second time with 85% accuracy.

(was nearing the end with used skittles, so it's accuracy and speed dropped dramatically)

The model was created in openscad. The code for the model is not up to stuff, but it works well enough due to how openscad works.



The bottom_base model has little mold things that you put them in, this was to make installation a bit easier and allow us to change motors if the need arose (they were added earlier).

If you are in the class or doing a similar assignment, do not copy my code and model. If you are trying to create a 3D skittle sorter, I will confess, it is no easy journey. It will be hard. You practically need to own a 3d printer (I recommend at time of writing, the "anycubic Vyper").

The best mindset you can have when making the model is to figure out the big non changing stuff first, things that need little iteration. Make those the biggest prints possible. Things that will need rapid change, make as tiny and fast to print as possible, *cough* motor cases *cough*. You will need to plan ahead, do not get too sidetracked, and make sure YOUR PRINTER IS ALWAYS PRINTING! If it is not printing, you will suffer pain.

My arduino code can not detect purple, due to the rotator I used. The color just did not work out for me. 

The solution I came up with is that the bottom base of the sorter, the top motor defaults to the purple skittle slot in the middle slot.
